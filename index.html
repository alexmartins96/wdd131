            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>My name is Alex Martins. I was born in Sao Paulo/Brazil and I live currently
                with my wife in Utah/United States. I am currently working as Store Manager
                in a 7-Eleven convencience store. I love spend time together with my wife,
                and I love to travel and know new places.

            <h1>Utah</h1>
            <p> Utah is a beautiful and diverse state located in the western United States,
                known for its stunning natural landscapes and unique blend of desert,
                mountains, and forests. One of Utah's biggest highlights is its incredible
                outdoor recreation opportunities, from skiing in the world-famous resorts 
                near Salt Lake City to hiking and exploring the red rock formations in
                national parks like Zion, Bryce Canyon, and Arches. Utah is also home to
                a strong sense of community, low crime rates, and a relatively low cost of
                living compared to other western states. Its rich cultural and pioneer 
                history, along with a growing economy and family-friendly environment,
                make Utah a great place to live, work, and explore.
